- **[custom-rag](./custom-rag)**: A custom RAG implementation featuring a streaming chatbot and data embedding pipeline.
- **[langchain-basics](./langchain-basics)**: Exploring the fundamentals of LangChain, including dynamic model selection, custom middleware, and multi-modal RAG.
- **[wiki-rag](./wiki-rag)**: A RAG system that scrapes Wikipedia for data, performs chunking and embedding, and provides a chatbot interface.
